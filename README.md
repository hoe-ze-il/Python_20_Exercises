# Python 20 Exercises

**1.** Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).

*Sample String :* "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are"                                                                                                                                                                         

*Output :*

```
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are!
		Up above the world so high,
		Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
	How I wonder what you are
